This repository contains notebooks and other files associated with my
**Machine Learning tutorials** primarily using [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) and [XGBoost](https://pypi.org/project/xgboost/).

## Installation Notes
This tutorial requries the following packages:

- Python version 3.5+
- `numpy` version 1.5 or later: http://www.numpy.org/
- `scipy` version 0.10 or later: http://www.scipy.org/
- `matplotlib` version 1.3 or later: http://matplotlib.org/
- `scikit-learn` version 0.14 or later: http://scikit-learn.org
- `jupyter lab` version 1.0 or later, with notebook support: https://jupyter.org/index.html
- `seaborn` version 0.5 or later: https://seaborn.pydata.org/
- `pandas` vesion 1.0.0 or later: https://pandas.pydata.org/
- `XGBoost` latest version: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/index.html

The easiest way to get these is to use the [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [miniconda](https://store.continuum.io/) environment manager.
I suggest downloading and installing [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) the easiest way as all the packages pre installed and you can start my tutorials immediatly.

## Downloading the Tutorial Materials
I would highly recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)if you are Windows, not only for this tutorial, but for the
general betterment of your life.  Once GitHub Desktop is installed, you can clone the
material in this tutorial by using the git address shown above or use the command line tool after installing just git:

```
git clone
git://github.com/KVSSetty/ml-notebooks.git
```

**If you can't or don't want to install any of the packages including python, anaconda and git. there is a link (button) below to directly reach the tutorial notebooks in your browser. Yes it is true run python code without installing python in your system. It is not Magic. Try it !**
